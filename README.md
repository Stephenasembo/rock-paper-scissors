# rock-paper-scissors
A fun and easy hand game anyone can learn and enjoy.

The entire game consists of 5 rounds whereby the player i.e the user or computer with the highest score is declared the winner of the game.

The logic of the game is that:

    1. Rock beats scissors but loses to paper.

    2. Paper beats rock but loses to scissors.

    3. Scissors beats paper but loses to rock.

    4. The counterparty for the user is the computer which randomly picks a choice from rock, paper or scissors.

    5. In the event of a tie i.e both players have the same choice both players are given 1 point each.

    6. For each round the winner is awarded 1 point and the loser is awarded 0 points.

    7. When the user enter's a word other than: rock, paper or scissors the input will be considered invalid and the user is awarded 0 points.

    8. The winner of the game is decided by the cumulative score of all 5 rounds.

    9. In the event both users have the same cumulative score the result will be output as a tie.
